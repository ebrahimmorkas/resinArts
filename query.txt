Okay it worked well. 
Now you see the banners (carousel) in the Home Page that keeps rotating. Now I want that image should be shown from backend. So in the backend you need to create the controller that can add the banner and delete the banner. In the Banner Model include the following. Image, Start date, end date, set as default. The same should be included in the form where we can add the banner. Create the route /fetcch-banners and in that all the banners should be displayed with the action button delete. Also include one more column in the table name isActive where we can see whether the banner is active or not.
Give names of the files such as :
Component: 
Banner.jsx
Controller:
bannerController.js
Model:
Banner.js
Routes:
bannerRoutes.js. 
Include the following routes with this name only.
/add -> Ton add the banner and function name should be addBanner
/fetch-banners -> To get all the banners in the tabular format and function name in controller shold be fetchBanners();
/delete/id -> To delete the bannner and the name of the function in the controller should be deleteBanner().

Please implement the following and give me code. No need to implement the server.js
