Developing ecommerce website using MERN stack and tailwind css. Give me all files in jsx. I am using react and not next js and not typescript as well.I have uploaded Home.jsx in which I want few changes.This file was created with old Product document in mongodb. Now my document and Product schema has been updated so I want changes in this code.Let me expain you the Product Document.If you see empty strings in price, image at the top level that means product have variants and fileds like price, stock, image, additional images are present in the variant of the array.Changes needed:-1. As you can see in the my code when user clicks the varianst button the variants of the product is being displayed but in the current code there's no implementation to show the additional images for that variant and size..2. In the current code inside variants the size is being displayes as L, XL, etc but now size has been changed in DB and now it has become to length, breadth, height so now this should be reflected. size is being present in variants array inside it moreDetails array and inside it size is present.3. In the samplee you can see that there are additional fileds such as dicountStartDate discountEndDate, discountPrice. If discountEndDate is greater than today's date then instead of price the discountPrice should be displayed to user and you can see in the code that some product has badge on the top left of the product so over there 'discounted' should be displayed.
4. You can also see lastRestockedAt field in the sample. If that field contains date then the product should be displayed in the restocked section and restock badge should be displayed on the product and the product should be displayed in the restcok section untill 3 days after the date present in lastRestockedAt.
5. In the current ProductCard thers's no share button. Create share button so that user can copy paste the link and share with someone or share directl;y with the help of whatsapp.
6. In the current product card for the variant which is displayed recently there is Add To Cart button. Over there implement the functionality so that user can also enter the quantity the user want's to add to cart
