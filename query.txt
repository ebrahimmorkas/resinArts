Okay you did it very great but there are some little minor problems that can't be ignored
1. Whenever I try to add new imageby clicking on 'Add image' button, I need to click on it two times. When I click first time below it some box appears and then I need to click on it again and then file explorer opens.
2. The same happens when clicked on 'Change Image' button.
3. Okay now when we edit some category name and don't save it and clicks on close button of edit modal so it prompts the discard changes modal and this is very good. Now I want this same functionality for image as well then when someone selects the image and then don't save it at that time this discard changes modal should be prompted. Also when user has selected the image for one category and haven't saved it, and then tries to select the image for another category at that also show discard changes prompt.

I hope so you have understood and kudos to you for solving mine complex problems
