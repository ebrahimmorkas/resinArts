I a creating e-commerce website using MERN stack and tailwind css. Now I want to create the professional look for table that displays all the categories. However I have created the table that provides professional look and I will you the code and you need to design it exactly. I will give the name of file as AllCategories.jsx.

The code from which you need copy:

Include this rows in the table that you will create. 

Checkbox (By selecting this all the rows of the table will be selected)

Sr No.

Image

Name

Created At

Actions ---> This column will contain the buttons

The Action columns should contain the following button:

View Hierarchy

Edit

Delete

Display edit and display buttons in symbol format. 

When click on delete button then display the professional Modal that asks for confirmation and when confirmed delete it and show message through react toasts.

Checkbox logic: 

When more than one row in table is selected through checkbox then above the table this buttons should be displayed: Delete and Edit ---> ( Show text and symbol both ) and hide the actions column completely. 

When clicked on view hierarchy at that time the complete hierarchy of that particular category should be displayed. I am using nested categories for eg: 

Electronics:

    |- Mobile:

           |- Vivo:

                |- V11

           |-Oppo 

    |- Laptop

           |- HP

I hope so you understood my categories structure. Now I am already fetching all the categories when the application starts through Context API. I have provided you the code. 

CategoryContext.jsx:import { createContext, useState, useEffect } from "react";
import axios from "axios";

export const CategoryContext = createContext();

export const CategoryProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [loadingCategories, setLoadingCategories] = useState(true);
  const [categoriesErrors, setCategoriesErrors] = useState("");
  const [categories, setCategories] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchCategories = async () => {
      try {
        const res = await axios.get(
          "http://localhost:3000/api/category/fetch-categories",
          { withCredentials: true }
        );
        setCategoriesErrors("");
        setCategories(res.data.categories);
      } catch (error) {
        console.log("Problem while fetching categories " + error.message);
        setCategoriesErrors(error.message);
      } finally {
        setLoadingCategories(false);
      }
    };

    fetchCategories();
  }, []); // ðŸ‘ˆ run only once on mount

  return (
    <CategoryContext.Provider
      value={{ categories, loadingCategories, categoriesErrors }}
    >
      {children}
    </CategoryContext.Provider>
  );
};


Now this is the sample of Category from mongoDB. 

First sample:

{

  "_id": {

    "$oid": "68c2de50c1b7b732e50ab748"

  },

  "categoryName": "Electronics",

  "parent_category_id": null,

  "image": "https://res.cloudinary.com/djn2jtaez/image/upload/v1757601359/categories/ae6smxufivtcivlgohgv.jpg",

  "createdAt": {

    "$date": "2025-09-11T14:36:00.174Z"

  },

  "updatedAt": {

    "$date": "2025-09-11T14:36:00.174Z"

  },

  "__v": 0

}

Second sample:

{

  "_id": {

    "$oid": "68c2de50c1b7b732e50ab74c"

  },

  "categoryName": "Mobile",

  "parent_category_id": {

    "$oid": "68c2de50c1b7b732e50ab748"

  },

  "image": "",

  "createdAt": {

    "$date": "2025-09-11T14:36:00.215Z"

  },

  "updatedAt": {

    "$date": "2025-09-11T14:36:00.215Z"

  },

  "__v": 0

}

I am using cloudinary to store images and I am using axios to make API calls. My API Endpoints looks like: http://localhost:3000/api/category/route_name. I have created the route file and controller file. Give this route for delete : http://localhost:3000/api/category/delete-category/{category_id} and give the name of controller function as deleteCategory(). Now if possible also provide the mechanism to delete the sub category or any other nested sub category when clicked on view hierarchy button.

I have created the cloudinary.js file inside utils folder.

utils/cloudinary.js:const cloudinary = require("cloudinary").v2;
require("dotenv").config();

// Configure Cloudinary
cloudinary.config({
  cloud_name: process.env.CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME,
  api_key: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_KEY,
  api_secret: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET,
});


module.exports = { cloudinary };

Show loading spinner (minimal overlay spinner) when the categories are being fetched and when any other operations are performed. 

The design should be modern and professional looking and the design should be responsive so that it can work on any larger or smaller screen devices. Now if you want anything from me say me I will provide you the requested file but if you want anything then don't generate the code first ask me the thing required.
