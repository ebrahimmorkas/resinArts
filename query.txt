Okay now I want to create the form for AddProduct. Name shoud be given as AddProduct.jsx.
The form should include the following:
name, stock price, image.
Below it display the dropdown named 'main category' and besides it only display the dropdown if and only if the main category contains the sub category and name this dropdown as 'sub category'. Also show the category path starting from the main category.
if the above fields such as stock, price, image are not filled then display the section such as:
Variants.

Admin should be able to add multiple variants section. This section should contai the fields such as:
Color name, Size :- Admin shoud be able to add multiple textfields for this size field and this size textfield should contain of three fields that is 'Length', 'Breadth', 'Height' and dropdown with values such as'cm', 'm', 'inch'.
Now display the textfield for price and besides it display the dropdown saying 'Is this price common' by default should be 'yes' and another option should be 'no'. If user selects no then all the combination of the entered color and entered size should be displayed and besides it the price textfield. For eg if color is red and sie is 1 X 2 X 3 and color is red and size is 4 X 5 X 6 then display it like this:
red, 1 X 2 X 3 besides this field for price and same for another one if user selects no.
Now the same should be applied for stock.
