I am developing e-commerce website using MERN stack. I have created the categories selection process in AddProducts.jsx. I want you to replicate that exact process in Users.jsx in pay free cash modal when admin clicks on pay cash button in table. Category selection process: There are two Dropdowns 1. main category dropdwon say MCDD and 2. sub category dropdwon say SCDD. Now when user selects the main category from the main category dropdwon then all the sub categorues of the selected main categorues gets rendered in the SCDD. Then user selecrts the sub category from SCDD. Now if that selected sub categry again have sub categorues then all the sub categories of the selected sub category from SCDD should be rendered in SCDD and this process continues till the selected sub category in SCDD does not have further sub categories. When selected sub category in SCDD does ot have further sub category then SCDD should be hidden ---> implemented in Addproduct.jsx. Also maintain the clicjkable path of sleeted categorues  ----> implementedi AddProcuct, implement in the same manner in Users.jsx.
