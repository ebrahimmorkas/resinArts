Woo you did it but with some problems. Great, The UI was exactly the same as I expected. 
Problems:
1. We can't update the image, deleting works fine. Error from cmd where backend is started :- Error updating category image: {
  message: 'Missing required parameter - file',
  name: 'Error',
  http_code: 400
}
2. When we update the name of category or add new sub category then it is not reflected in the edit modal immediately, we need to close the modal and then when we reopen the edit modal at that time we can see updated data.
3. When we click on delete button in hierarchy in edit modal so nothing happens but as soon as when we click on close button of the modal at that time the confirmation for delete is displayed and when we confirm the deletion takes place.
4. When we are editing the category and then click the edit for another category in the hierarchy of edit modal so nothing happens and the category which we were currently editing remains intact and no modal of discarding data is displayed and then when we try to close the modal at that time it asks for this confirmaion modal

Please fix all these errors at once. Do it in one go, I should not again complain yopu
