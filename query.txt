This is the code given by you for resin arts ecommerce website Home page which is written using react and  tailwind css.

Code:

The design of the website is very beautiful but there are some minor changes that needs to be done:

Add the logo 

We need to change the color scheme of the website so that it suits the color scheme of the logo.

You have created 'New Arrivals This Week' section below the Hero section. In this section only put all the items that are newly arrived and it should be scrollable and remove the button name 'Explore latest Arrivals' from the hero section and put 'Explore restocked items'.

Below shop by category section create another section such as Revised rates and put dummy products in it and it should also be scrollable. Also show some badge on the product such as 55% off and in the price section show strike on the actual price and then revised price.

In the featured products section the first product is of big size. Resize it to normal means the size should be same of all the products card.

Below you have created the section for latest arrival change it to restocked items and when clicked on Explore restocked items go to that section.

The website is not at all responsive. It should work in mobile view as well. Make it so much responsive so that it can work on worlds largest device to worlds smallest device.
